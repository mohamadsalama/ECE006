Human coronaviruses, first characterized in the 1960s, 
are responsible for a substantial proportion of upper respiratory tract infections in children. 
Since 2003, at least 5 new human coronaviruses have been identified, 
including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, 
which caused significant morbidity and mortality. 
NL63, representing a group of newly identified group I coronaviruses that includes NL and the New Haven coronavirus, 
has been identified worldwide. 
These viruses are associated with both upper and lower respiratory tract disease and are likely common human pathogens. 
The global distribution of a newly identified group II coronavirus, HKU1, has not yet been established. 
Coronavirology has advanced significantly in the past few years. The SARS epidemic put the animal coronaviruses in the spotlight.
